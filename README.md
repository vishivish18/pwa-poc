###Mean-Minimal (Boilerplate for MEAN Apps, extracted from Mean-Machine)



=======================



This is an extracted minimal version from the mean-machine boilerplate I created, this version contains nothing extra and provides
just a base to start. I created it for static sites and for projects which need to focus only on the angular part.
For better static site serving I will create a node-jade combo later.
